## 🚀 **The Problem I'm Solving**

Have you ever wondered **who's using your WiFi** and **how much bandwidth they're consuming**? Or noticed your internet slowing down but couldn't figure out why? 

This project tackles a real-world problem that affects millions of households: **network congestion and inefficient bandwidth distribution**. Instead of just showing you what's happening *right now*, this system will learn from your network patterns and help you optimize connectivity for everyone.
