Test script for AI Network Usage Predictor

This script demonstrates how our AI analyzes network monitoring data
to provide intelligent insights about usage patterns and optimization opportunities.

This testing shows:
1. Real AI implementation (not just buzzwords)
2. Data science pipeline (data → analysis → insights)
3. Professional error handling and validation
4. Business-value focused machine learning
5. Quantifiable success metrics for recruiters
